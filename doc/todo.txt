wrappers
	change to preproc
		advantages:
			good for # and function name, line/file in error output
		disadvantages:
			messy
			error-prone
			not ideal for functional blocks
				if ((a = FOPEN()))
				(if FOPEN() is preproc for a block of code, that won't work,
					and these wrappers will probably be somewhat complicated)
